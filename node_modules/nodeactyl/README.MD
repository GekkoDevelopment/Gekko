`This API will now merge the client + admin together, the admin commands are here but just not docuemnted, an IDE may reveal these functions, theyre pretty self explanitory but they will be documented soon`

This API is written in NodeJS, i originally made this because  i needed a bot that can interact with my panel. The only library that exists for it is for JDA (One might exist for python or other languages but idk). 

While this was originally meant to work with Discord.js, it will work with any of NodeJS librarys, such as socket.io and more!.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install nodeactyl
```

## Getting started
First, follow the installation instructions, then you will need to have the following in your code.

`System Admin API`
```javascript
const Node = require('nodeactyl');
```

After importing the API, you need to "login" to your panel/server like so:

```javascript
const Node = require('nodeactyl');

Node.login("PANEL URL HERE", "ACCOUNT API KEY HERE");
```


## What am i?
Nodeactyl is an API For NodeJS to communicated with the panel, you can control ANY server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!) . Thie library original intent was to be for discord bots, but since this is in NodeJS, it is usable in ANY type of NodeJS program You can remake your own UI for the panel, and just stick with the pterodactyl daemon, doesnt suit you? use it in socket.io and have your node/server information displayed on a webpage! The possibilitys are endless! 

## How do i work?
This API works by using the pterodactyl API (Curl requests) to the server/node, by gathering the Panel website, Account API and a server/node ID. This library depends on axios, a promise basid http/https request system, this is how nodectyl is able to send curl commands to pterodactyl. The API itself is VERY simple and i am extremely suprised that no one has even tried making one (There are probably private ones, but none are avaliable to the public).


## Documentation
